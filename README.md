## Overview of use

E2e-runner coordinates the entire e2e run against a Workflow [chart](https://github.com/deisthree/charts/tree/master/workflow-dev), including:

  1. Coordinating the leasing of a GKE k8s cluster via [k8s-claimer](https://github.com/deisthree/k8s-claimer),
  1. Cleaning up the leased cluster if need be (primarily deleting the `deis` namespace if still exists),
  1. Setting up the local [helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) install on the leased cluster (deleting the `tiller` deployment if necessary),
  1. Installing the Workflow and [Workflow-e2e](https://github.com/deisthree/charts/tree/master/workflow-dev-e2e) charts (setting particular values if necessary),
  1. Monitoring to see when these charts are up and running,
  1. Following and capturing chart logs and placing them where Jenkins/others can find them before deleting the cluster lease and exiting.

See the main [run](https://github.com/deisthree/e2e-runner/blob/master/scripts/run.sh) script for the basic outline of actions presented above.  It is a good entry point into the finer details of e2e-runner functionality.

## Running the tests on CI
To run the tests for a jenkins job you should have a `docker run` command that looks like the following:

```
env > /home/jenkins/workspace/${JOB_NAME}/${BUILD_NUMBER}/env.file
docker run \
  --env-file=/home/jenkins/workspace/${JOB_NAME}/${BUILD_NUMBER}/env.file \
  -u jenkins:jenkins \
  -v /home/jenkins/workspace/${JOB_NAME}/${BUILD_NUMBER}:/home/jenkins/logs:rw \
  quay.io/deisci/e2e-runner
```

A few different things are happening here. First we export all the local environment variables to a file so we can pass those into the container at runtime. This allows us to use secret text values for things like `$AUTH_TOKEN`. When we call `docker run` we make sure we specify the user `jenkins:jenkins`. This way the container has write permissions into the volume mount.

## Running the tests locally
```
$ docker run -e AUTH_TOKEN=$AUTH_TOKEN quay.io/deisci/e2e-runner
```

## Environment Variables
* `AUTH_TOKEN` - Token needed to talk to [k8s claimer](https://github.com/deisthree/k8s-claimer)
* `CLUSTER_DURATION` - How long to lease the k8s cluster (default: `800 seconds`)
* `GINKGO_NODES` - How many nodes to use when running e2e tests in parallel (default: `30`)
